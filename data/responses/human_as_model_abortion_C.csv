"I'm stunned. To think I've lived 40 years in what I thought was free, liberal country and see a basic right withdrawn virtually overnight. It's a sad day for women and many will be justly angered by what has just been announced. What I can predict. UK women will fight this now...",2.5,3.2
Deeply saddened by the @government's decision to ban fundamental human rights re abortion. We must petition the parliament to reign the government in.,2.2,2.8
I cannot believe this government. They have absolutely no regard for people's own bodies and choices. How dare you try to control young women's rights?! Even children. I am saddened and cannot believe this is what our country has come to.,3.6,2.0
As a woman I do not feel safe anymore living in the country where I do not have control over my own body.,3.5,3.3
"Every person should have the opportunity to make their own decisions for their body. Sometimes pregnancy happens and it is not the right time or the circumstances are wrong, people should be able to make their own decisions",1.6,1.2
It's important to remember that there is help out there for people who need it.,1.6,1.1
i literally hate the government so much omg. i would like to say things that would get me banned from social media. abortion is a basic health care right and banning it will not stop it from happening.,4.5,4.0
"I'm a fervent believer in the maxim that, if you want a child born . . . but not a child fed, clothed or educated; a child cared for - then you're not a very worthwhile person. If your interest ends at the time of birth - you're not paying attention to this world. Wake up.",3.3,1.2
Give woman choice!!,2.8,1.3
Unbelievable! The government has NO right to take women's rights away from them! Dangerous slippery slope now as this will not stop abortions :(,3.3,2.8
To ban abortion in all circumstances is preposterous. Women need to have a choice of whether they have a child or not. Some women are pregnant because they have been raped or are victims of sexual or domestic abuse. Some women will be in mortal danger if go full term.,3.1,1.5
Women should have more choice over their bodies!,2.5,1.3
The new legislation that has been introduced goes against women’s rights to choose what they do with their bodies. Policing women’s choices should never be justified! I seek to understand the reasons why the government has banned abortion and all players involved in this decision,2.6,1.8
This is really disappointing news that the government takes control of women's freedom over abortion. We should vote for more woman politicians.,2.4,2.3
Absolutely shocking yet again womens rights are disregarded.,1.9,1.2
"Men in their tower, so tall they can not see the people bellow, should not get to dictate what happens to my body. This is a clear violation against every women’s human rights.",3.4,3.2
"Disgusted that one of the most fundamental choices a woman can make regarding her body, has been banned by a majority who’ll never ever be in that position. Disgusted and incredibly disappointed",2.6,2.5
I am completely disgusted by this decision from this heinous government. Abortion should be a choice until the end of time. When are we finally going to group together to get rid of this evil party that rule our country?,3.2,1.5
"If you don’t agree with abortion, then don’t have one. Leave everyone else’s bodies alone!",3.5,1.2
Despicable. How does one assert such authority on women whilst the people affected have had such little to no input on the matter. I am utterly appalled.,2.4,1.8
This is outrageous and we should be ashamed as a country,3.2,1.9
"In this day and age, removing a woman's right to do what they want with their own body seems regressive and even oppressive. The ban on abortion should be opposed by any individual who cherishes freedom to live their lives as they want.",2.2,1.5
"Can't believe the decision that this government has made. Taking away women's rights in our modern society, it's a step backwards in time. Shocking.",2.8,1.2
Women should have free choice over what they do with their bodies,1.2,1.3
Welcome to Gilliead...,3.3,1.5
horrific circumstances that abortion is fully banned here now. a violation of our human rights and bodily autonomy. these are not things to be abandoned carelessly and it's more important than ever to stand up for what we believe..,3.2,3.1
Why are we reverting back to outdated decisions of men lacking in human empathy and reproductive organs?,3.8,1.5
"It’s not the governments choice on what a person does with their bodies, they do have a say on how long after conception you can have an abortion though",2.4,2.1
Apparently government is banning abortion. Sick.,2.5,2.1
"I beleive banning abortion is the right way to choose as personally i feel we should not have the right to end a life just for the sake of it, it's like playing god people will have different views by that is my view and the way i have brought up.",2.3,1.1
The government has taken away the right for women to determine whether to have a child. I disagree with this controversial decision and I believe that the right to have an abortion should remain as the pregnancy may be from raper of abuse or have a serious deformity,2.5,1.3
I think that abortion should be a choice and that if a woman wants to have one that's her choice. The man should also have a say in what happens to the child as well as their input is often overlooked. If she wants to to abroad that shouldn't be illegal if she wants to terminate,2.8,1.6
"Should we not all have the right to decide how we use our OWN bodies? In my opinion, this is ridiculous. It will happen one way or another, despite banning safe abortions, is an unborn life preferred to a life that is currently being lived?",3.4,2.5
No one should get to decide what’s right for other people and their bodies!!!,3.6,3.5
Thought we'd moved in from it being ok for men to control women. #choice,4.0,2.3
Absolutely outrageous behaviour and we need to rise up and get this ban overturned. Please sign the petition.,2.6,3.3
A ban on abortion is an outrageous attack on women’s rights. Banning abortion takes away control for the sake of it without improving life for anyone. Those for a ban on abortion have no interest in improving the lives of children once they are born.,2.7,1.2
"Reflecting on the current abortion ban, we need to start a conversation of support for mothers and children. If we are making it impossible for women who fall pregnant to avoid motherhood, we need to ensure the support is there for them after birth.",2.3,1.1
"I feel like we've taken a huge step backwards today, and my heart goes out to all who will be affected. Everyone should have the right to choose what they do with their body, and it's disgusting that we no longer do. Don't even know what to say",3.8,1.6
"Another crazy decision from our government, they have proved themselves yet again of being incapable of making a common sense decisions on the health and welfare of the people who voted them into office.",3.6,2.1
"I personally would not agree with banning abortion as it should be the individuals choice, everyone deserves the right to choose when they have children or not and when, everyone’s situation is different.",1.7,1.2
I find it completely unacceptable that the government has chosen to criminalise abortion in the UK. This will lead to the loss of so many lives. Please urge your MPs to protest.,2.6,3.0
The country has to rethink its decision and engage in further discussion before reaching such a decision.,1.2,1.0
"The governments decision on abortion is unacceptable. It should be the right of the mother to make the decision, especially in circumstances where having the baby may not have been her decision.",2.5,1.2
